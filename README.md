Product Workflow - Solving Questions and Generating Graphs
Overview
Welcome to the repository for a product that offers a seamless solution for students to solve questions and generate graphs. This project utilizes advanced algorithms, OpenAI API, and Wolfram API to enhance the learning experience for students. The README provides an overview of the product workflow, key components, and the quality assurance process.

Workflow
1. Product Workflow - Solving Questions and Generating Graphs
This product offers a seamless solution for students to solve questions and generate graphs. Let's walk through the flow chart to understand how it works.
2. Flow
The process starts with the student inputting a question into our system.
3. OpenAI API Integration
The question is then sent to the OpenAI API, which uses advanced algorithms to solve the question and provide a step-by-step solution.
4. Text and Mathematical Expression Segregation
Next, the system segregates the question into the text and mathematical expression parts. This allows us to focus on solving the text part separately and handling the mathematical expression appropriately.
5. Wolfram API Integration
The mathematical expression is sent to the Wolfram API, which generates a graph based on the equation. This visual representation enhances the student's understanding of the problem.
6. Confidence Check Parameter
To ensure the quality of the solution, we have implemented a confidence check parameter. The obtained answer is compared against our database solutions, and if it surpasses the threshold, it proceeds to the result page.
7. Result Page
The result page displays the solved question, step-by-step solution, and the graph plot. The student can review and validate the answer.
8. Final Result Display
Once the answer passes the confidence check parameter and quality improvement process, it is displayed to the student on the result page, providing them with accurate and reliable solutions.
